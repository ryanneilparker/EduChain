# EduChain ⚖️🔗

A Decentralized Certificate Verification System (DCVS) built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## How to Get Started 🚀

Follow these instructions to clone, build, and run EduChain on your local machine.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

## Clone the Repository 📂

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the EduChain repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanneilparker/educhain.git
```

## Install Dependencies 📦

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd educhain
```

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build the Project 🏗️

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript and place the output in the dist directory.

## Running Locally 🏃

You can run EduChain locally either in regular mode or development mode.

### Regular Mode 🏁

To start EduChain in regular mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the application using the compiled JavaScript code in the dist directory.

### Development Mode 🔧

To run EduChain in development mode, which includes automatic recompilation and restart upon code changes, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and nodemon to monitor changes to the compiled files and restart the server accordingly.

## Accessing the Application 🌐
